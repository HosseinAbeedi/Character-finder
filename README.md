# Character-finder

This project can find a character in a long string in the fastest possible way.


# General explanations

The main part creates a long string and subtracts the string of letters from the first letter 
and sorts them alphabetically in a file (File 2). In the second part of the program it starts
the search from the first string and if character is present in the long string of letters,
it displays its position.
