# Character-finder
This project can find a character in a long string in the fastest possible way.
##General explanations
The main part creates a long string and subtracts the string of letters from the first letter and sorts them alphabetically in a file (File 2). In the second part of the program it starts the search from the first string and if a character is present in the long string of letters, it displays its position.
